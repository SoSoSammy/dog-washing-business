                anything
                through the Service.</p>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
                liable
                for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited
                to,
                damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
                injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the
                Service,
                third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with
                any
                provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of
                such
                damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
                consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
                each
                party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p><strong>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</strong></p>
            <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without
                warranty of
                any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
                behalf
                of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all
                warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all
                implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and
                warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
                Without
                limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
                representation of
                any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or
                work
                with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any
                performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
                corrected.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of

                from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs
                or
                other harmful components.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
                statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
                You.
                But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
                greatest
                extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
