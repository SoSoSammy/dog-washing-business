# Floofer's Dog Washing Website
## Overview
This project was for a Future Business Leaders of America Website Design competitive event. I worked with a team of 2 others to create a website for a fictional dog washing business. My teammates created the branding for the business while I designed the website using Figma and coded the design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
