## About The Project

This project was for a Future Business Leaders of America Website Design competitive event. I worked with a team of 2 others to create a website for a fictional dog washing business. My teammates created the branding for the business while I designed the website using Figma and coded the design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is purely front-end based and there is no implementation for scheduling appointments and payment processing.

**Key Features:**
* Social media posts on homepage
* Services page with detailed descriptions
* Contact form with Google map
* Google calendar with available appointments
